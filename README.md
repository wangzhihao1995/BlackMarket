# BlackMarket
> BlackMarket is an infomation exchange platform that helps NSDers **trade** their courses in the first week of every semester. It is intended to reduce the **asymmetry of infomation** during the **grabbing-course** period. 

> The next version of [Black Market](https://pkublackmarket.cn/) for 2017 Fall is under development.
